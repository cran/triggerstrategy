Description: The trigger strategy is a general framework for a multistage statistical design with multiple hypotheses, allowing an adaptive selection of interim analyses. The selection of interim stages can be associated with some prespecified endpoints which serve as the trigger. This selection allows us to refine the critical boundaries in hypotheses testing procedures, and potentially increase the statistical power. This package includes several trial designs using the trigger strategy.
